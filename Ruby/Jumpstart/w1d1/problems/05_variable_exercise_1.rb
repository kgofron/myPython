# Time to practice variables! Follow the comments for instructions.

# 1. Declare a variable named `firstName` and assign it your first name as a string:


# 2. Declare a variable named `lastName` and assign it your last name as a string:


# 3. Declare a variable named `fullName` and assign it the concatenation of
# your `firstName` and `lastName`. Be sure to put a space between your
# first and last names:


# 4. print out the `fullName` variable:
firstName = "Kazimierz"
lastName = 'Gofron'
fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName
puts fullName
